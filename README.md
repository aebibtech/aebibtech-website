# Aebibtech Portfolio Site

This repo contains the source code to my portfolio at <https://aebibtech.com>. I utilized [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) to create the site. Feel free to fork/clone it. Enjoy!  

I followed the Next.js [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn) as a starting point in creating this portfolio site.
