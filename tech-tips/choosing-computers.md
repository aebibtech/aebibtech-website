Usually people Wondering which PC to choose? Well, it depends on how it will be used.

Instead of featuring certain desktop and laptop models here, I will be putting here what to look for when choosing and purchasing a PC. I often get asked, *"What PC and specs would you recommend for me?"* I will be answering that question by creating this guide.

## Desktop vs Laptop
If you will be using the computer mostly at home, then choose a desktop. If you will be needing a computer while travelling, then choose a laptop.  
Generally, desktops costs less compared to laptops. You can get a desktop with better hardware specifications compared to a laptop at a certain price.
***
## Basics
Make sure you look at the specifications before you buy. These specifications apply to both (desktop and laptop).  
For decent performance for basic usage (e.g. Web browsing, documents, spreadsheets), look for these:  
* **Memory Capacity: 8 GB** RAM | *More memory = more programs running at the same time. Especially if you open multiple browser tabs!*
* **Storage:** At least **128 GB Solid-State Drive** | This ensures responsiveness while using your PC. Get an NVMe SSD as much as possible.
    - You can use a large-capacity USB External Hard Disk Drive (or SSD) for storing personal files. Just be careful not to drop it (if HDD).
***
## Gaming
PC Gaming requires much faster components. Given that, a gaming PC is more expensive. A graphics card is required.  
# Desktop Specifications
* **Processor:** At least Intel Core i3 (8th or 9th Generation) or AMD Ryzen 5 (2nd or 3rd Generation)
* **Motherboard that supports the processor of choice.**
* **Memory:** 2 x 4 GB (8 GB) DDR4-2666 RAM, upgrade to 2 x 8 GB (16 GB) if you play games that require a lot of memory (such as PUBG)
* **Storage:** 128 GB NVMe SSD + 1 TB SATA SSD
* **Graphics Card: At least NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 470**  
* **True-rated PSU (Power Supply Unit)** | This ensures power reliability for the components.
* **Gaming Mouse** | A gaming mouse has a high resolution which allows better accuracy while gaming.
* **Optional: Uninterruptible Power Supply**
# Laptop Specifications
Most laptops advertised as gaming laptops can really game! Just check these before purchasing:
* **Processor:** At least Intel Core i5 (8th or 9th Generation) or AMD Ryzen 5 (2nd or 3rd Generation)
* **Memory:** 2 x 4 GB (8 GB) DDR4-2666 RAM, upgrade to 2 x 8 GB (16 GB) if you play games that require a lot of memory (such as PUBG)
* **Storage:** 128 GB NVMe SSD + 1 TB HDD (you can upgrade to an SSD later)
* **Graphics Card: At least NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 or AMD Radeon RX 560X**  
* **Gaming Mouse** | A gaming mouse has a high resolution which allows better accuracy while gaming.
