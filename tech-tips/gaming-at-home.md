## PC Specifications
* Make sure that the PC that you use for gaming is powerful enough to run the game. Refer to the game's system requirements.
* Make sure that the PC has a **graphics card**. Gaming on integrated graphics is terrible unless you turn the game's quality settings down.
* Make sure that the PC has at least **8 GB of RAM**.

## Traffic Shaping
Make sure that you have a router that can do traffic shaping. If you don't have one, then you have to get one.  
**OR**  
Follow these guides:  
- **[pfSense Install Guide](/guides/pfsense-install/)**
- **[pfSense Limiters for Online Gaming](/guides/pfsense-limiters/)**
<!--more-->
to turn an unused PC into a router that can do traffic shaping.
<!--more-->
Having a router that shapes traffic enables you to play online games while anyone watches videos online `(e.g. YouTube, Netflix, Facebook Memes)` or while anyone downloads through torrent.  
If you don't have the budget yet, then schedule your gaming time when **no one else is using the Internet connection.**
***
## Windows Update
**Install Windows updates first before gaming.** Gaming while installing updates will slow the PC down unless you have a very powerful PC.
* Go to **Start -> Settings -> Update & Security -> Windows Update**
* Click **Check for Updates** and let it finish.
***
## Close Other Applications
Closing other applications while gaming may help especially if your PC has little RAM.  
`Close Google Chrome with 10 tabs open.` Google Chrome by default uses the graphics card to render a web page.
