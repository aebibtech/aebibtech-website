Buying laptops from online marketplaces and meet-ups? Then this guide is for you!
<!--more-->
I was looking for a used laptop on Facebook Marketplace for a friend. I found one that says "Lenovo ThinkPad." The seller wrote in the description that it has a 3rd Generation Intel Core i5 processor and a 1 TB hard disk drive. I went ahead to transact since it fits my friend's budget. I contacted the seller and scheduled a meet-up immediately. Upon meetup, the seller showed the specs through DxDiag (DirectX Diagnostic Tool). Okay, it shows that it has 3rd-gen Intel core i5. I paid the money and the seller was on a hurry to go. Wonder why?

Upon rebooting, I went to the BIOS of the laptop. I found out that it was a 1st Generation Intel Core i5 processor! The laptop also overheats! 1st-gen Intel processors overheat a lot. I was also wondering why Windows 10 boots so fast (hard disk drives are slow!) because it has a 1 TB HDD according to the description from the seller. I found out that it has a 128 GB Solid-state Drive with a ~800 GB virtual hard disk (VHD). I realized that I got scammed! I also found out that the seller's Facebook account is not his real account. I created this guide to help other people from being scammed online when buying a laptop.

## Knowing What to Check in a Used Laptop
* Try to charge the laptop.
* Check for any physical damage.
* Check the Display for dead pixels and spots.
* Check if the exhaust fan is spinning. 
* Check if the laptop overheats. *This can be skipped if you are confident in replacing the thermal paste.*
* Test the keyboard keys one-by-one.
* Test the touchpad.
* Check the sound.
* Run a memory test

## Where to look for the Laptop's Hardware Specifications
If the laptop has Windows 10 installed, then Go to the **Task Manager**. Go to the **Performance** tab. Click **CPU**. It will show the real processor model that the laptop has.

You can also check the **Device Manager** to check what hardware devices are present in the laptop.

Go to the laptop's **BIOS**. One can find system information from there regardless of installed OS.

## Where to Buy Used Laptops
From a marketplace that allows item returns. For example, [Lazada](https://www.lazada.com) (Available in Southeast Asia)  
From a company, avoid individuals as much as possible. You can return defective items to a legitimate company. One can sue a company that doesn't allow such returns!  
***
## Meet-up
Make sure that you are going to be checking and operating the laptop. If the seller does not allow you to do so, then do not buy the laptop.

# Conclusion
Knowledge is really power! Avoid getting scammed by knowing how to check used laptops. No one deserves to get scammed.
