## Using the Laptop
Follow these recommendations when you use your laptop:  
- **Use your laptop in a dry place.** Water and beverages can cause damage to your laptop.
- **Use your laptop in a place where the laptop's air vents are not blocked.** This prevents the laptop from overheating.
- **Use your laptop in a stable place.** This prevents the laptop from falling and therefore breaking.
- **Do not use your laptop in a very hot place.** Computers deteriorate when there is too much heat.
- **Turn off or hibernate the laptop when it is not in use.**
- **Don't use sleep mode when you intend to put the laptop in a bag.** It might cause overheating.
- **Prevent the battery from emptying.** Always doing so will cause the battery to deteriorate.
- **Unplug the charger when the laptop's battery is fully charged** except when you are downloading large files or something important is in progress. Leaving the charger plugged in will cause the battery to deteriorate.

## Laptop Overheating
Overheating is usually present on older laptops.  
These are the reasons why the laptop is overheating:  
- **Too much dust** - Too much dust can block the laptop's air vents.

- **Exhaust fan is not spinning** - If the exhaust fan is broken, then the heat cannot get out and cause overheating.  
- **Dried thermal paste** - The thermal paste is a material between the processor/video card die and the heatsink. If it is dry, then the heat from the processor or video card will not be able to be transferred to the heatsink and cause overheating.

**Refer to your laptop's disassembly guide for replacing the exhaust fan and the thermal paste.**
